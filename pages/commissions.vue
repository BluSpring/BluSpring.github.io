                <strong>General Information</strong><br>

                1. No NSFW in any way is allowed.<br>

                2. Once the commission is paid for, I shall place your commission in a queue to be finished.<br>

                3. I reserve the right to decline any commission request.<br>

                4. Any personal information given will be kept private and confidential.<br>

                <br>
                <strong>Usage and Rights</strong><br>

                1. I do not allow my work to be minted as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).<br>

                2. You are not allowed to claim the commissioned work as your own.<br>

                3. Commissioned works must not be used for profit, with videos and Minecraft servers being exceptions, unless stated in an agreement.<br>

                4. I reserve the right to choose the completed commissions for promotion or as examples for myself, however you may state if you do not wish for this 
                to be the case.<br>
                
                <br>
                <strong>Cancellations and Refunds</strong><br>

                1. At any time, I reserve the right to cancel any unpaid commissions, cancel and refund paid commissions, or put commissions on hold as a result of 
                poor communication, rude or inappropriate behaviour, or any kind of abuse. This right will also apply if I have encountered any serious problems
                regarding my personal life, health or equipment.<br>

                2. Commissioners will be notified prior to cancellation.<br>

                3. Commissioners may cancel a work in progress, or withdraw from their place in the queue, but they will not be granted a refund.<br>
