            <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
            <h4>By commissioning me, you are agreeing to these terms of service.</h4>

            <p>
                <strong>General Information</strong>

                1. No NSFW in any way is allowed.

                2. Once the commission is paid for, I shall place your commission in a queue to be finished.

                3. I reserve the right to decline any commission request.

                4. Any personal information given will be kept private and confidential.


                <strong>Usage and Rights</strong>

                1. I do not allow my work to be minted as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).

                2. You are not allowed to claim the commissioned work as your own.

                3. Commissioned works must not be used for profit, with videos and Minecraft servers being exceptions, unless stated in an agreement.

                4. I reserve the right to choose the completed commissions for promotion or as examples for myself, however you may state if you do not wish for this 
                to be the case.
                

                <strong>Cancellations and Refunds</strong>

                1. At any time, I reserve the right to cancel any unpaid commissions, cancel and refund paid commissions, or put commissions on hold as a result of 
                poor communication, rude or inappropriate behaviour, or any kind of abuse. This right will also apply if I have encountered any serious problems
                regarding my personal life, health or equipment.

                2. Commissioners will be notified prior to cancellation.

                3. Commissioners may cancel a work in progress, or withdraw from their place in the queue, but they will not be granted a refund.
